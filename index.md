My name is Pengze Li, a college student from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), majoring in Electronic Science and Technology. My research interest focuses on computer vision (e.g., denoising, image processing, recognition) and its applications in real-world problems. Now I am applying for postgraduate programmes.

### Research Experience
_Research on Denoising Network Acceleration Based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)_<br>
_Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Science_<br>
_Academic Supervisor: Jian Cheng (Research Fellow), Chenghua Li, May 2021~Present_<br>

In this project, our lab focused on denoising network acceleration based on convolutional neural networks. The research was run in PyTorch, a popular machine learning library, and on GPU (RTX TITAN). Currently, we are summarizing and illustrating our research outcome on a paper, which will be submitted to IEEE CVPR 2022. Here are some of my work:<br>
* Reproduced and retrained serveral video-denoising models, all of them were based on or designed from recent papers. <br>
* Tested and reduced the inference time while keeping PSNR(Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) high. <br>
* Pruning was the first way I turned to, and I also developed some other architectures and tried many tricks. 

_<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Linsonng/Linsonng.github.io/blob/main/snowboard1.mp4">Here</a> is a small demonstrate video showing the achievement of the denoising project. Gaussian white noise with a standard deviation of 30 is added to the original video as the upper one. The following video shows the denoising results given by the convolutional neural network in 0.5 seconds. Pause at any time to observe the performance of denoising (loop playing may help)._

**Multiscale Strip Pooling DLinkNet Enhanced by Channel-wise Attention Mechanism for High Resolution Aerial Image Road Extraction**<br>
_Academic Supervisor: Dr. Junli Yang, Sep.2020~Present_<br>

In the DeepGlobe Road Extraction Challenge, our team aims to receive a better IOU score than other teams. Based on DLinkNet, we managed to improve the score through reproducing and training models on the 3090ti server using PyTorch. We also designed the fusion consisting of multiple models, such as ResNet, D-LinkNet, SENet, D-block, Transformer, and some other new modules. After adopting the pooling feature map to adapt the narrow-and-slender feature in road extraction tasks, we received expected improvements in IoU scores. Moreover, we conducted road extraction tasks based on Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and compared the results of them, which showed that CNN performs better.<br>

Recently, we have completed a paper named Multiscale Strip Pooling DLinkNet Enhanced by Channel-wise Attention Mechanism for High Resolution Aerial Image Road Extraction, which will be soon submitted to Remote Sensing.The research was also run in PyTorch, and on GPU (Tesla V100)<br>

**National University of Singapore Online Winter Programme: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**<br>
_Academic Supervisor: Assoc. Prof. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/motani?originalSubdomain=sg">Mehul Motani</a>, Jan. 2021~Feb. 2021_

This is early and guiding experience in my research.<br>
In the National University of Singapore Online Winter Programme, I studied some supervised learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, SVM (Support Vector Machine), Neural Networks, and Confusion Matrix, mainly about their concepts and working principles. Besides, I reproduced these models with Python.<br>

Moreover, I leveraged these models and some other extended models to predict the future population of Singapore and China as a completion assignment.<br>

**Research on 5G Frequency Allocation Based on Water Filling Algorithm**<br>
_Academic Supervisor: Prof. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ee.ucl.ac.uk/~kwong/">Kai-Kit Wong</a> Jul. 2020~Oct. 2020_<br>

When I was focus on telecommunications, I joined this research in which I studied the communications knowledge of cellular network and frequency planning, including system modeling, channelfading, water-filling power allocation algorithm, and frequency reuse algorithms often used in 4G/ 5G networks, such as IFR(Integer Frequency Reuse) and FFR(Fractional Frequency Reuse). Models were built on Matlab to simulate signal transmission of QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM, etc. Based on the FFR frequency multiplexing algorithm combined with soft frequency reuse (SFR) technique, optimized the frequency allocation algorithm and improved spectral efficiency finallye improved anti-noise performance and channel capacity.<br>
