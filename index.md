## Research Experience
**High Resolution Aerial Image Road Extraction**<br>
_Academic Supervisor: Dr. Junli Yang, Sep. 2020 ~ Jun. 2022_<br> 
Road extraction is a fundamental task in the field of remote sensing which has been a hot research topic in the past decade. In the CVPR DeepGlobe Road Extraction Challenge, our team made Multiscale Strip Pooling DLinkNet Enhanced by Channel-wise Attention Mechanism. We also designed the fusion consisting of multiple models, inlcuding **ResNet**, D-LinkNet, SENet, D-block, Transformer, and some other new modules. The work is on the 3090ti server using PyTorch. After adopting the pooling feature map to adapt the narrow-and-slender feature in road extraction tasks, we received expected improvements in IoU scores. <br>

Regarding this work, a patent is pending and a paper will be sent to Remote Sensing soon.<br>

**Pedestrian Classification**<br>
_Academic Supervisor: Dr. Da Guo, Prof. Xile Cao.  Jan. 2022 ~ Jun. 2022_<br> 
This is my graduation project, cooperated with the engineers from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aidong-ai.com/">Aidong Beyond Artificial Intelligence Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd.</a>. Taking advantage of the private dataset of pedestrians in the factory provided by Aidong, I processed real industrial datasets and completed a pedestrian recognition model based on **ResNet**, in which **data augmentation** and **SE Module** are applied. The accuracy is greater than 96% (TP+TN)/(TP+FN+FP+TN). Considering the needs of industry, this project ran with TensorFlow.
