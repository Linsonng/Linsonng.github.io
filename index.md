My name is Pengze Li, a college student from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), majoring in Electronic Science and Technology. My research interest focuses on computer vision (e.g., denoising, image processing, recognition) and its applications in real-world problems. Now I am applying for postgraduate programmes.

### Research Experience
Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Science<br>
Research on Denoising Network Acceleration Based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)<br>
Academic Supervisor: Jian Cheng (Research Fellow), Chenghua Li, May 2021~Present<br>

In this project, our lab focused on denoising network acceleration based on convolutional neural networks. The research was run in PyTorch, a popular machine learning library, and on GPU (RTX TITAN). Currently, we are summarizing and illustrating our research outcome on a paper, which will be submitted to IEEE CVPR 2022. Here are some of my work:<br>
* Reproduced and retrained serveral video-denoising models, all of them were based on or designed from recent papers. <br>
* Tested and reduced the inference time while keeping PSNR(Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) high. <br>
* Pruning was the first way I turned to, and I also developed some other architectures and tried many tricks. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Linsonng/Linsonng.github.io/blob/main/snowboard1.mp4">Here</a> is a small demonstrate video showing the achievement of the denoising project. Gaussian white noise with a standard deviation of 30 is added to the original video as the upper one. The following video shows the denoising results given by the convolutional neural network in 0.5 seconds. Pause at any time to observe the performance of denoising (loop playing may help)._
